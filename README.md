# CarfaxTechnicalAssignment
The purpose of this assignment is to create an application that connects to used car listings  backend in order to retrieve and display car listings data. 

This is the initial MVP for the application.

The <b>app does not use</b> real phone numbers instead it will use <b>123-456-7890</b> as a demo. The real phone numbers can easily be added to the application.

Also more changes will be added to the backend code for offline support, use of Kotlin, RxJava and Dagger2.
